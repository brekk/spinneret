## 0.1.0 (2025-03-01)


### Features

* **alt:** style alternate, still not feeling quite right ([07f0f11](https://github.com/brekk/spinneret/commit/07f0f117d4d629b7c0fbb794bba038331a738271))

* **decorators/state:** still incomplete, but a good start ([592fcaa](https://github.com/brekk/spinneret/commit/592fcaab82b47ef56f413f8e244948ca492c8c27))
* **decorators:** starting to get cleanererererere ([6a4277c](https://github.com/brekk/spinneret/commit/6a4277cc9344697cfa180c17fd69e91f13cb20d9))
* **Example:** this is an incomplete idea for how to wire examples ([f2c1a75](https://github.com/brekk/spinneret/commit/f2c1a75472e019867c53cc9620ba3bd0496e61d3))

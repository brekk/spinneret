Make building the web simple again.

Spinneret is an attempt at creating a simple web framework that is largely a functional wrapper around native DOM behavior. It uses easy-to-reason-about patterns to make simple and reusable building blocks to construct a webpage with. It is performant, accessible and has a tiny footprint (20k gzipped). See it in action [here](https://brekk.github.io/spinneret)
